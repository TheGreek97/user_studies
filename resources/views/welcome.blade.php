                    <br>
                    I would like to invite you to participate in this research project which forms part of our
                    research. Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to
                    understand why the research is being done and what your participation will involve. Please
                    take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish.
                    Ask me if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.
                </p>

                <div class="text-lg pt-3 font-bold italic" style="color:darkred"> What is the purpose of the study?
                </div>
                <p class="text-xl max-w-4xl text-left pt-4">
                    The purpose of the study is the usability evaluation of the prototype of an email client we are
                    developing. We are indeed testing this prototype with users to address possible usability
                    and UX problems and improve it.
                </p>

                <div class="text-lg pt-6 mt-6 font-bold italic"> Why have I been invited to take part? </div>
                <p class="text-xl max-w-4xl text-left pt-4">
                    You are being invited to participate in this study because you decided to take part through
                    the Prolific platform. Any English-speaker user of 18 years of age or older is eligible for this
                    study, with no specific restrictions on demographic or expertise levels. Participants are also
                    asked to own a personal computer (laptop, desktop, etc.), possibly in a quiet and peaceful
                    place where they are sure not to be disturbed during the activity. Participation via
                    mobile/tablet/other devices is not allowed.
                </p>

                <div class="text-lg pt-3 font-bold italic"> What will happen if I take part?</div>
                <p class="text-xl max-w-4xl text-left pt-4">
                    If you agree to take part you will complete a study anonymously. The study will ask you to
                    interact with the prototype of an email client by imagining yourself as Alice, a fictious 28-
                    year-old employee that was asked to test the new email client of her company. You, as Alice,
                    have to interact with the client by reading all the emails in her inbox and checking that any
                    links in them work. At the end of the study you will be asked to fill in a few brief questionnaires
                    to express your evaluation to what you will experience during the study.
                    <br><br>
                    The study will take you approximately 20 minutes to complete.
                    <br><br>
                    As part of participation you will be asked to provide your honest and considered answers to
                    the questionnaires you will be administered. The interaction with the email client should also
                    not be rushed. You must not insert any data that could identify your person in your answers.
                    You need to insert your prolific ID (which we cannot link to your identity) to receive the
                    compensation for the participation to the study and to link your demographic (anonymous)
                    data to your response.
                </p>

                <div class="text-lg pt-3 font-bold italic"> Do I have to take part?</div>
                <p class="text-xl max-w-4xl text-left pt-4">
                    Participation is completely voluntary. You should only take part if you want to and choosing
                    not to take part will not disadvantage you in anyway. If you choose to take part you will be
                    asked to provide your consent. To do this you will be asked to indicate that you have read
                    and understood the information provided and that you consent to your anonymous data
                    being used for the purposes explained.
                    <br><br>
                    You are free to withdraw at any point during completion of the study, without having to give
                    a reason. Withdrawing from the study will not affect you in any way. Once you submit the
                    study, it will no longer be possible to withdraw because the data will be fully anonymous.
                    Please do not include any personal identifiable information in your responses.

                    The reward for participating in this study is of £3.50, above the Prolific average compensation of
                    £9/hour.<br>
                    <b>Important:</b> in order to redeem the reward for participation, the completion link at the end of
                    the study must be clicked, which will redirect the browser to the Prolific website to confirm the
                    participation. If this last step is skipped, it will be impossible for us or Prolific to acknowledge
                    a user actually completing the study.

                    There is no actual risk in participating in this study. You will be exposed to emails that were
                    specifically handcrafted for this study and any link in them will be disabled to prevent
                    accessing external websites.

                    outputs/publications. Your data will be held securely for a minimum of 10 years after the
                    study has been completed, as recommended by
